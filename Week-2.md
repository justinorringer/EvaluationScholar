Minutes:
- Meeting started out with a reviewal of due dates
- Justin brought up our project requirements and Dr. Rothermel started giving his perspective
- FR 1.2 Processing CVs is not a huge priority, could input from txt or excel
- First iteration could just take a list of papers in txt or excel or whatever works, later on can tackle CVs
- FR 1.3 Google Scholar will show papers by name and include extra 
- Potentially gather all papers and then point to potential problem papers for manual review
- FR 2.2 likes this one, hadn’t thought of it
- Displaying Statistics section gets a checkmark
- NF2. Yes, he wants to be able to use it for people applying for jobs, or compare productivity to that of peer institutions
- Will run into the issue of not being able to gain paper information for peer schools’ faculty. Will need solution
- Next, Tyler reviewed our scraping tools.
- ScraperAPI at 29 a month is financially acceptable
- All have free trials, he agrees that it is a good idea to try them out to see if they will work for us.
- Question and Answer time with Dr. Rothermel
- He included a zip with a file giving amount of papers per faculty (roughly 80 on average)
- Annually, a faculty review would be a heavy use and there would be lots of queries for every member
- Not intending to share to other universities, but down the line might to his colleagues
- Not everyone is on Google Scholar, but it shouldn’t be too much an issue
- Privacy is not a concern, it is all public information 
- Duplicates are not too frequent but there may be a few
- Google Scholar is not a reliable source for gathering paper names. He will provide lists 
- Tags for institution may be useful
