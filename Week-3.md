Meeting started out with introductions of attendees
- Justin presented a demonstration of the scraping solution that we have currently put together
to showcase its abilities to Dr. Rothermel.
- Carter and Gage presented an outline of the plan for development of the solution through
different
- Dr.Rothermel noted that an author search may have an issue with people that have
similar names, and there may be a challenge in picking out a specific person
(examples such as Dr. Singh or Dr. Gu)
- The team proposed solutions such as a date or publication location that may help in
refining the search.
- Tyler explained the current architecture design to Dr. Rothermel to better explain the tools
that will be used for development.
- Question and Answer time with Dr. Rothermel (presented by the team).
- As far as interacting with the visuals go, Dr. Rothermel was curious as to the value
that would be present in interacting with visuals. He feels that this would be a
secondary requirement to producing the data.
- Carter asked how Dr. Rothermel intends to use the graph, and Dr. Rothermel
mentioned that he would want to select subsets of faculties (by rank, by areas, etc.) up
to the size of the full set. He also mentioned the benefit of being able to include time
frames on the graph presentations. Dr. Rothermel mentioned that he would better
establish some example queries of how he would plan to use the system.
- In terms of abstracting the scraping, Dr. Rothermel finds value in being able to have
the solution be coupled at a low level so that the scraper can be swapped so that new
tools can be integrated if something were to become more feasible.
