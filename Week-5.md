Minutes:
- Meeting started with Tyler introducing the agenda.
- Tyler updated Dr. Rothermel about the scrapper being integrated into the application and the react container has also been set up.
- Gage discussed and walked through the wireframes with Dr. Rothermel.
- Dr. Rothermel discussed two different approaches for the application.
   - Mention the name of the author while adding an input file into the application.
   - Automatically get the name from the internet with the help of the scrapper when only inputting the file.
- A decision was made by everyone to go with the approach 1 for iteration 1.

- Our goal is to finish and demo the iteration 1 by next week.
- Discussed the three different graphing libraries with Dr. Rothermel.
   - Apex Charts
   - Toast UI
   - Nvd3
